# QNHCQA Memory Allocator

## QNH.... The f*ck does that even mean?
#### _Were you drunk, when you made up that name?!_
Apart from the fact that I do not drink ... The acronym 'QNHCQA' stands for  the latin expression _"Quia non habent clue quid agam"_, which basically translates as _"I do not have a clue what I am doing"_.

#### _Oh wow - why should I even look at this code?_
Pro tip: don't.

#### _Why couldn't you just use a cool name like "Venator", "Executor" or "(Null)Terminator"?_
Because this project would require to be cool and well-thought of and have an awesome documentation and have an API for Node.js ... _\*vomit\*_
The other reason is that I just want to see the look on the faces of my fellow students when they see me spamming their GitHub-feed with random-character-repositories.
